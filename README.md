# Solid Chess

This is a decentralized Chess app, build on top of [Solid](https://solid.inrupt.com/).
No central sever is required to run or set up a game.
All personal data about the game is stored on your POD.
Requests to join and updates of a game are sent to the inbox of your opponent directly.

Check the [live version](https://pheyvaer.github.io/solid-chess/) or the [screencast](https://streamable.com/tf8yv).

WARNING: The "Clear inbox" button **removes all files with (chess) game data** in your inbox! So be careful!
